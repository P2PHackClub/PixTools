## Challenges we ran into
* This was the first time I had ever worked with databases before, and it was super confusing! In the end, I didn't have enough time during the hackathon to implement a feature. - James

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* I'm really proud that we were all working as a team, even through remote calling and internet snafus. I was worried at the beginning that we wouldn't be able to bond as a team as we would in person, but it was an amazing experience. - James

## What we learned
* I learned the basics for creating SQL databases, how to write discord bots, and how to use ESLint. - James

## Challenges we ran into
* I figured time constraints would make a developed product that didn't live up to the standards set by ourselves, yet either way in the time we were allotted it looks good! - Arihant

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Getting myself out there to actually join a team instead of going solo sounded like a good change and I'm glad I was able to interact with more parts of the community due to it.

## What we learned
* My understanding of video-edition has been pushed plus re-familiarizing myself with JS and Discord Bot Creation
