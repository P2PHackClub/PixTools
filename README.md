# PixTools
*A Discord bot for Hypixel queues..*

PixTools is a Discort Bot built in discordjs for people who love to host Hypixel games with their friends. PixTools makes your life easier as a host by managing a minigame queue for discord members to add minigames to.

This discord bot was initially created in 24 hours at the digital MLH Hack at Home hackathon by [@Giavern](https://github.com/Gigavern), [@SuperCoderDamian](https://github.com/SuperCoderDamian), [@thatrobotdev](https://github.com/thatrobotdev), and [@thematrixdev06](https://github.com/thematrixdev06).
